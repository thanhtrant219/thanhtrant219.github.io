[Firefly Cartography](https://adventuresinmapping.com/2016/10/17/firefly-cartography/) with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Each point on the map is a location for which there was at least one confirmed Coronavirus case as of 3/5/2020. Each location is shown as the same size and intensity, regardless of how many cases there were (this is a shortcoming of this visualization).
